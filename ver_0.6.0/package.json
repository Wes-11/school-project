  "description": "this is an early build that has all working features but requires styling and db connection optimization
                  EDIT: added addditional functions and removed code no longer being used from modules consisting of
                  1) getUnique
                  2) isUnique
                  3) create account
                  4) updateFav
                  IMPROVED:
                  1) some bad DB connections have been fixed to properly release the connection back to the pool
                  2) commented code was removed
                  3) many console.log lines were removed as they were no longer necessary",
